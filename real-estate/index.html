                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>My name is Zokir and I stumbled into the world of real estate by accident. For many years, I worked in a corporate field unrelated to real estate. In 2018, I purchased my first condominium apartment, but I was unaware of the many complexities involved in the process. I didn't know anything about mortgage rates, property taxes, condominium bylaws, HOA fees, and more. That purchase caused me many headaches and sleepless nights. I even had to join the board of managers of the condominium to ensure the building was being run appropriately and to deal with contractors, engineers, city services, and management companies.</p>
                    <p>Through helping my friends with their own real estate purchases, I realized that I had learned so much about the industry and could help others avoid the mistakes I made. As a software engineer, I have a passion for delving into the nitty-gritty details of each property, including property taxes, HOA fees, and cash flow for investors. I decided to become a real estate agent so that I could use my knowledge and experience to guide others in the process and help them make informed decisions. </p>
